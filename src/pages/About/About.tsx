            At the beginning of my career, I found a passion in
            front-end development making intuitive, responsive, and accessible
            experiences for users. My understanding of both front-end and
            back-end allows me to bridge the gap between design and
            functionality to deliver dynamic, efficient and scalable solutions.
            I enjoy increasing developer efficiency, tackling complex issues in 
            fast-paced environments, and collaborating with teammates and stakeholders.

          <p>
            I love creating and enjoy experimenting with different hobbies. Some
            of my favorites are laser crafting, stained glass, and
            yarn/needlework. Much like with my career, I love learning new
            things and trying new crafts to create beautiful and often useful
            things.
